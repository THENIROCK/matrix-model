# Deep Quantum Geometry of Matrices
Here is the implementation of the variational quantum Monte Carlo for low-energy states in mini-BMN matrix models. The wavefunction ansatz consists of generative flows for bosons and superposition of free states for fermions. For more details please see arXiv:1906.08781.

## Setup
> **_Additional step for M1 M2 M3 processors:_** Tensorflow and Python 3.7 don't natively run on these chipsets. So you will need to: 
1. Install Rosetta 2 `/usr/sbin/softwareupdate --install-rosetta --agree-to-license`
2. Create empty environment `conda create -n py37`
3. Activate `conda activate py37`
4. Use x86_64 architecture channel(s) `conda config --env --set subdir osx-64`

### Normal Setup
I recommend Anaconda (https://www.anaconda.com/) for environment setup. Please install Anaconda from the website and create an environment as follows:

  1. Run the command `conda create -n tf tensorflow=1.13 tensorflow-probability=0.6.0 matplotlib` to create an environment named `tf` (feel free to use other names);
  2. Activate the environment by `conda activate tf`;
  3. There are several bugs in implementations of gradients for complex matrices in TensorFlow 1.13. As a quick fix, run `pip show tensorflow` to see where the TensorFlow packages are located, and replace `tensorflow/python/ops/linalg_grad.py` in the TensorFlow directory by the copy in this folder;
  4. I recommend running the tests `python tests.py` to make sure that the environment is setup properly. All tests should pass (in ~1h) and you will see `OK` after the command finishes. 
  
## Demo
Demonstration code is in `demo.py`; please check out the source code for its arguments and usage. As an example, the command `python demo.py maf 2 1.0 -f 2` will search for the ground state of the `N = 2` and `nu = 1.0` mini-BMN with `-f 2` fermions, using Masked Autoregressive Flows.
